Build and install check_lm_sensors

Dependences
===========

check_lm_sensors depends on several Perl modules:

 * Carp
 * English
 * Getopt::Long
 * Monitoring::Plugin
 * Monitoring::Plugin::Threshold
 * version

Perl modules can be found on the "Comprehensive Perl Archive Network"
(CPAN). The "How to install CPAN modules" guide summarizes how these
can be installed

        http://www.cpan.org/modules/INSTALL.html

On many systems Perl modules are also available as installation
packages (refer to your system documentation on how to install them).

The 'perl Makefile.PL' command (see below) will list the missing
packages the you will need to install.

Install to /usr/lib/nagios/plugins/contrib
==========================================

In the source directory run:

    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make install

Install to a custom directory (CUSTOM_DIR)
=========================================

In the source directory run:

    perl Makefile.PL INSTALLSITESCRIPT=CUSTOM_DIR
    make
    make install

You can override the INSTALLSCRIPT, INSTALLNBIN or INSTALLSITESCRIPT
variable depending on your perl installation.

The man page is installed to /usr/share/man/man1/check_lm_sensors.1
you can customize the path by setting INSTALLMAN1DIR as follows

    perl Makefile.PL INSTALLSCRIPT=CUSTOM_DIR INSTALLMAN1DIR=CUSTOM_MAN_DIR
    make
    make install

Manual installation
===================

Substitute #!perl at the beginning of the script with the location of
your Perl interpreter and copy it to the desired location

Generate the man page with pod2man

    pod2man check_lm_sensors.pod > CUSTOM_MAN_FILE

Please report any installation problem to <matteo@corti.li> or
